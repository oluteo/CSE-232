## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
"Factorio" is a popular game that involves creating complex automation systems, including uranium processing using centrifuges. This C++ program emulates the operation of a uranium centrifuge in Factorio by calculating the production of uranium-235 and uranium-238.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>
- C++ compiler

## Usage<a name="usage"></a>
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Input the operation time and initial ore quantity.
4. The program will simulate the centrifuge's operation, returning the amount of uranium-235 produced.

## Function<a name="function"></a>
The main function of this program is:

- **Centrifuge**: This function simulates the operation of a uranium centrifuge. It takes three parameters: `time` (the total operation time in hours), `ore` (the initial ore quantity), and `u_238` (a pointer to the uranium-238 produced). It returns the amount of uranium-235 produced during the centrifuge's operation.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>
1. Download the provided C++ source code file [main.cpp](main.cpp).
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler to create an executable.
3. Run the compiled executable.

## File Structure<a name="file-structure"></a>
